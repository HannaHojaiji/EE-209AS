### Introduction
The seamlessing pairings of off-the-shelf wearable sensors may lead to inaccurate sensor data collection and loss of devices due to the lack of user attentions.

### Objectives
Our authentication system aims to secure and associate sensor readings of a user’s body sensor network to that particular user.In addition, the system provides actionable feedback and on-board abnormality detection when verifying the integrity of a body sensor network. It notifies the user about the lost/stolen node in the body sensor network before that node loses its bluetooth connection.

# Deliverables
- An Android app that authenticate and periodically verifies whether a three-device sensor network (phone, moto 360 watch, and eSense  earable) is on the same body  
- Data analysis plots of collected sensor data from some of these  devices’  accelerometers and gyroscopes 
- Codes and scripts that authenticate phone and wearables, periodically check body sensor network integrity, record the sensor data,  and analyze the correlations among the sensor data
- Video demo that illustrates the uses of our Android app in recognizing lost/stolen devices and notifying user to recover them.

### Welcome to GitHub Pages.
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.

### Designer Templates
We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.

### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
